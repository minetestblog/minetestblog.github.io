## Briefing <a name="overview"></a>
Minetest 5.5 was released last month, with some significant improvements. Colour Hop has received some major updates. Creatura has joined minetest's collection of performant mob apis.

## Engine News <a name="engine"></a>

Minetest 5.5.0 has been released! 

While you may not see many visible changes, there's been a considerable amount of work under the hood to improve the rendering system. Minetest now uses its own fork of the Irrlicht rendering library, which will make further improvement easier. It's already allowed several longstanding bugs to be fixed. 

Be warned: when you update to 5.5, it'll upgrade worlds to a new map encoding (Maps will now take up to 20% less space!). This is irreversible, and will prevent you from running those worlds on older Minetest versions. If you aren't sure about the upgrade, then backup your map beforehand. 

There were some interesting changes to the modding API. Various features have been de-hardcoded, allowing mods and games more control. For example, liquid features have been decoupled from liquid drawtypes (making it easier to make things like spiderwebs). Player fall damage is also changeable using armor groups; you can avoid red flashes from disabled fall damage. 

Possibly the most interesting change to the API was an upgrade to the dynamic media API. Modders and game creators can now send media to individual clients, and label it as "ephemeral", meaning the client will forget it when they disconnect. Previously, dynamic media was sent to all clients, and became part of the media sent to clients on when they joined. With the new version, individualized media is finally possible! The applications are huge, especially regarding background music (BGM), which used to extend login times enormously. BGM can now be sent one track at a time after the player has joined. 

As always, you can check out [the full changelog](https://dev.minetest.net/Changelog#5.4.0_.E2.86.92_5.5.0). Also see the [official announcement](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=27754).


## Game News <a name="games"></a>

Talas has just released version 1.2 of Colour Hop! 
This includes some fundamental changes to the game, giving each player colour an activated ability.
The story (or lack of) has been expanded upon and a completely new boss was added.
There are some new advanced buildings that players can build, most are unrelated to the dragons.
As usual, things are hidden and finding the new boss will take much exploration.
The game is still a work-in-progress, but it's getting closer to a complete game.

Super Sam Adventures is a WIP jump'n'run game by [BuckarooBanzai](https://content.minetest.net/users/BuckarooBanzay/) that promises fun platforming for minetest. While it is obviously in early stages of development, it is already  playable, and even slightly engaging, with secret areas, moving platforms, and several levels.

## Mod News <a name="mods"></a>
[ElCeejo](https://content.minetest.net/users/ElCeejo/) has released a trio of updates to his animal mods, as well as a new mob api to base them on. 

![The Monster Invades](/assets/img/the_monster_invades.png?raw=true "The Monster InvadesBlob")

[Draconis](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ElCeejo/draconis/) improves the gameplay of multiple Minetest games, like Minetest Game, Voxelgarden, and MineClone. It gives more incentive to traverse your worlds' mountains and caves, and provides engaging mini-boss fights. After defeating a Dragon, you may find an Egg. The mysterious Egg-hatching process can be puzzling, but it rewards you with a new, destructive companion with which you can take to the skies when its old enough, and it unlocks a new tier of weaponry and armor. The Libri Draconis book can help you discover elements of the mod by unlocking certain objectives with the book in your inventory.


[Animalia](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ElCeejo/animalia/) adds life and depth to experiences with livestock, pets, and ambient creatures. You can create farms for eggs, milk, and meat. You can use a Horse to quickly traverse ground, perhaps with a Wolf companion at your side. And you can enjoy ambient sounds of in-game Animals throughout most biomes. The builtin documentation, Libri Animalia, acts as a journal which you expand by clicking on animals with the book. There is currently a vote underway on the forums for which set of animals to add next to Animalia.

[Creatura](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ElCeejo/creatura/) makes creating a new mob relatively easy, while not cutting corners on features. You can take advantage of the Utility Stack system for smooth decision making, enchance behaviors using Theta* Pathfinding for lifelike paths, and even use the implemented boids algorithm for realistic flocks and swarms. 

--------------------------------------

[Loosewheel](https://content.minetest.net/users/loosewheel/) has been updating lw_components with more mesecons devices. The latest additions were digilines-controlled storage, and a security camera that can actually take "photos"- rough representations of the scene in front of it that remind you of early maze graphics. One of the most exciting recent additions is a force field generator:
![Force Field](https://i.ibb.co/sbRcL9v/force-field-demo.png?raw=true "Force Field")
lw_components seems to be a real contender to other mesecons-compatible automation mods, and without the high entity-count, it may be a lower lag option. 

--------------------------------------

[OgelGames](https://content.minetest.net/users/OgelGames/) has released a mod that adds a wearable headlamp on Content Database (CDB).

--------------------------------------

[Zughy](https://content.minetest.net/users/Zughy/) is modding again! He recently updated Arena_lib, adding the ability to control the sky to minigames made with the library. It allows you to tweak clouds, sky colors, skybox backgrounds, and more!

--------------------------------------

[Apercy](https://content.minetest.net/users/apercy/) is back at it, making more great vehicle mods. This time its cars. These cars are two-seaters. They have working headlights. They have wheels and steering wheels that turn. They run on fuel. They detect elevation and tilt to match the elevation under them. Best of all, they are low-lag and extremely playable. The latest addition to the fleet is the coupe below:

![An Essay in Dwarf-Sculpture](/assets/img/essay_in_dwarf.png?raw=true "An Essay in Dwarf-Sculpture")

temhotaokeaha has been making cool banners for games:

## Server News <a name="s-news"></a>
YourLand is preparing chat integration with discord. A nice side effect is a WIP [matterbridge mod](https://gitea.your-land.de/AliasAlreadyTaken/yl_matterbridge) that will allow bridging server chat to any of discord, irc, matrix, and much more, all at once.

runs' server is back online; this time running the development version of his new game "The Samz". Its limited to 3 players currently.
